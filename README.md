# ðŸ§  Kidney Stone Detection Using CNN (Jupyter Notebook)

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify medical images as **Normal** or **Kidney Stone** using only **Jupyter Notebook** with TensorFlow and Keras. It is part of the AICTE Internship program.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Objectives

- Detect kidney stones in medical images using deep learning
- Train and test using labeled image datasets
- Achieve high accuracy with VGG16/InceptionV3-based CNN
- Visualize model performance (accuracy, loss, confusion matrix)

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. **Install Dependencies**

Use pip to install required packages:
pip install tensorflow keras matplotlib numpy opencv-python

Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
To isolate your dependencies:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

ðŸ“Š Model Performance (Example)
Metric	Value
Accuracy	96.2%
Loss	0.12

ðŸ“Œ Add your actual results after training.
